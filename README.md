## Lessons Learned

While making this project we learnt the use of an efficient Python module named as Kivy. Apart from it we also learnt to read data from QR Code and use it for further purposes.

The Challenges we faced while making this project were-

1.Converting the .py file into an apk file was a tedious task

2.Reading data from QR Code and using it in making invoices was bit challenging too.
